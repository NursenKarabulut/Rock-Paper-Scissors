Rock-Paper-Scissors is a hand game that is typically played between two people. The game involves each player making a choice of either rock, paper or scissors with their hand, and then revealing their choice simultaneously. The winner is determined by a set of rules that dictate which hand gesture beats the others.

The basic rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors are as follows:

  Rock beats scissors (by crushing them)
  Scissors beats paper (by cutting it)
  Paper beats rock (by covering it)
  If both players choose the same gesture, it is a tie and the game is usually played again.

The game is often used as a decision-making tool or as a way to settle disputes in a playful manner. It is also sometimes used in tournaments or competitions.

Rock-Paper-Scissors is a simple and fun game that can be played by people of all ages. Its simplicity and popularity have also made it a subject of study in game theory and psychology.
